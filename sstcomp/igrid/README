Interactive Console Break Example

This code provides an example of breaking into an interactive console from
a component (in this case in the event handler). It defines a breakEnable
variable that can be set from the command line. It can also be set from
the interactive console to turn the break capability on/off during execution.
Note that setting breakEnable from the command line enables it for all
components. However, modifying it from the interactive console must be done 
for each component. So, for example, you could "set breakEnable 0" for the 
instance in component 0 but it would still be enabled in other components. 

This version uses the BaseComponent::initiateInteractive() functionality
to break into the interactive console. This is different from the 
interactive_rt branch which used the realtime action directly. (This is an
invalid use of realtime actions per Sandia.)

This example could be expanded to support more complex debugging funtionality.
